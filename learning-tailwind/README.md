<h1> Mini Project - first steps learning Tailwindcss</h1>


<p>This first project is a web page designed to promote my favorite hobby. Amigurumi is a Japanese technique that uses crochet to weave 3D dolls.

The page is responsive and also has the option to switch to dark mode.</p>

> <h3>About the project</h3>

<p>
This project was my first contact  with Tailwindcss, and I made it following the instructions for an <a href="https://<h3>">Udemy course</a>.

With this project I got an idea of:
* How to install Tailwindcss and some required dependencies;
* How to configure and how to set up the compilation process;
* At the end of the course module I learned also how to get the project done for production using <a src="httpshttps://purgecss.com/"> purgecss</a>. 

This project showed me also some usages of alpinejs and how to use it to do my page more dynamic. Like helping to build the dark mode theme.

Also, important to mention that I learned how to work with outsource classes in Tailwindcss.
